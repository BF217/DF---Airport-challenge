# Airport Challenge

# Overview

- I have developed a console application that seeks to help effectively manage traffic going in and out of an airport. The aim of this software is to solve problems effecting operations and improve efficiency, adaptability and safety.

# Problems the software is solving

1. The need to manage airport capacity. The software allows for a maximum capacity to be set, and keeps digital records of the number of planes currently at the airport, ensuring that the space is correctly utilised.
2. The need to adjust the maximum capacity. The software provides the ability to change the maximum capacity anytime to rapidly meet fluctuations in demand or respond to emergency situations. This could also include any future extensions to the airport such as a new terminal.
3. The need to manage takeoffs and landings efficiently. The software provides Air Traffic Controllers with the ability to manage planes effectively by ensuring takeoffs/landings can only happen when the right conditions are met eg. a plane can only land if the airport is not at maximum capacity.

# Benefits to the client

1. Safety: By ensuring planes cannot land or takeoff without meeting safety requirements, the software reduces the risk of incidents occuring.
2. Flexibility: By allowing the maximum capacity to be changed, the software provides flexibility to airport managers to respond quickly to unexpected situations or surges in demand, improving response times.
3. Communication and decision making: by automating several key safety checks, such as whether the airport is full, the software allows Air Traffic Controllers to make better decisions and reduces the chance of human errors.
4. Scalable and adaptable: The software can easily be adapted and scaled to meet the ever changing requirements of an airport. As such, it can be used long term to effectively manage the needs of an airport.

# Potential risks

1. Technical failures. As with all software, errors can develop overtime, so as a precaution, it is advisable to develop a contingency plan and backup any important data.
2. Data accuracy. The software relies on data to be accurate to function, therefore, it is critical that employees input the correct information to the terminal.
3. External threats. It is important to be vigilant of any cyber attacks and follow best practices on cyber security principles to ensure the software is protected from malicious intent.
